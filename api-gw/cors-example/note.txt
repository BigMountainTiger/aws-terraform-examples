The examples are in the "api-method-example" and "swagger-example".

To enable cors
1. POST - look at the example in "api-method-example"
2. GET - If special header is sent from the request (ie. Authorization, etc), cors is required.
    look at the example in "swagger-example", it requires "request_templates" to work.
