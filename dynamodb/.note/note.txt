1. Dynamodb point-in-time recovery is pretty cheap and the price only depends on the size of the table, but not the backups

2. Dynamodb put and update are similar, but put "REPLACE" the item if already exists, but update so an "UPDATE" on the attributes
    - If an attribute is not in the payload, it will not be updated (no change)
