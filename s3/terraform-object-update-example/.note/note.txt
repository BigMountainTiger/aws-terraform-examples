This example experiments how terraform update file to s3 bucket

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/-/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_object

1. Terraform only upload the file once
2. If we want the terraform to upload the file when it changes, we need to add the "etag" property
3. It is better to use "source_hash" because it does not have the limitations on the "etag"

Differences:

The "source_hash" is saved in terraform state
The "etag" is a property of the aws resource

It seems sha512 is unable to include the changes on file "-rw-rw-r--"
