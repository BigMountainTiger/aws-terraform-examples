What does sync do?
- Syncs directories and S3 prefixes.
- Recursively copies new and updated files from the source directory to the destination.
- Only creates folders in the destination if they contain one or more files.


include & exclude
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/#use-of-exclude-and-include-filters


1. Basics
    --exclude "<value>" and --include "<value>" 

    - *: Matches everything
    - ?: Matches any single character
    - [sequence]: Matches any character in sequence
    - [!sequence]: Matches any character not in sequence

2. The rule is the filters that appear later in the command take precedence over filters that appear earlier

    --exclude "*" --include "*.txt" => All files will be excluded from the command except for files ending with .txt
    --include "*.txt" --exclude "*" => All files will be excluded from the command.

3. Each filter is evaluated against the source directory.

    - If the source location is a file instead of a directory, the directory containing the file is used as the source directory.
    - aws s3 sync /tmp/foo s3://bucket/
        => The source directory is /tmp/foo
        => Any include/exclude filters will be evaluated with the source directory prepended.


4. The "aws s3 sync" command determines that a file needs to sync by the following standard by default,
    it is possible to change the default by the command-line argument "--size-only".

    - The file does not exist at the destination
    - The file size is different between the source and the destination
    - The modification time of the file at the source is newer than the destination
