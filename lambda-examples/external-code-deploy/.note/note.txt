# This is an experiment to test 
    - How terraform work with external code deployment for the lambdas
        - Make sure terraform does not overwrite the exterally deployed code
    - This is also an example to use nested terraform modules

It is confirmed that terraform will only deploy the lambda code at the creation time
    - source_code_hash = base64sha256("Never_replace_lambda_code")
    - Give a static source_code_hash that never changes
