https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/cloudwatch_log_resource_policy

The resource based IAM policy on cloudwatch log groups is different
- It is not attached to any log group
- It is set on the cloudwatch logs in general
- It can not be set through the AWS console, it can be set by AWS CLI and terraform

See the example in the iam.tf.
The name of the policy needs to be unique among all "aws_cloudwatch_log_resource_policy", either created by
terraform, AWS CLI or any other means
