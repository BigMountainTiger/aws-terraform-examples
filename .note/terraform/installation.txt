Install terraform

1. Terraform is a single executable
    - It can be downloaded here - https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/
    - Since terraform version needs to match what specified in the project
        - it is more convinent to download the executable and create a symlink to it
        - When needed, it is easier to change the link to point to the desired version

2. We can also add the terraform repository for the "apt" and use "apt" to install terraform
    - https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli
    - It is easier to keep the terraform version updated, but not very convinent to revert to older versions
