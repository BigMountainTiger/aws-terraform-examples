    - Repeatable Migrations only run if the script file changes

4. Undo - U
    - Flyway Undo is a commercial feature of Flyway and isnâ€™t available in the Community Edition
    - Flyway can not really undo anything, so it is better to just roll-forward. used versioned script with a name indicating that it is "undo"
