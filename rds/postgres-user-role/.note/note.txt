1. In postgres, a user is actually a role that has the login capability

2. Database roles are global across a database cluster installation
    - Not per individual database
    - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/user-manag.html

3. To drop a role
    - You must drop/reassign all the objects it owns
    - Revoke any privileges the role has been granted on other objects
    - It is not necessary to remove role memberships involving the role
    
4. Droping an database object seems automatically revoke all the privileges to it
    - Most dropping of database objects has the "CASCADE" option
