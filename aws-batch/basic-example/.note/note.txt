AWS batch has almost the same functionality as ECS
It is more difficult to use, and the AWS console UI has some bugs, looks like not many people using It
AWS batch creates an ECS cluster and use it (which is easy to do by ourselves).

This batch example works
But ECS is more easy to use for the same capability

AWS batch requires 3 IAM roles:
1. The role on the compute environment is to grant it the ablility to manage the a ECS cluster
2. There are 2 roles on the Job definition in the container property. The Execution role is for it to pull the docker images and start the container
3. The job role is for the job to perform its actual work, like S3, etc.
