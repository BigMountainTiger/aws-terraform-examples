Transfer a domain to anther AWS account
Now can be done on the console
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-between-aws-accounts.html

When a domain is transfered, the hosted zone is not automatically transfered
We can create a new hosted zone in the new account
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-migrating.html

After creating the new hosted zone, we need to update the domain register (AWS domain in this case) name server
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-inactive.html

Steps:
1. In the Route 53 console, get the name servers for your Route 53 hosted zone:
- In the navigation pane, choose Hosted zones
- On the Hosted zones page, choose the "radio button" (not the name) for the hosted zone, then choose View details
- On the details page for the hosted zone, choose Hosted zone details
- Make note of the four servers listed for Name servers

2. Use the method provided by the registrar for the domain to change the name servers for the domain to use the four Route 53 name servers
