If a record shows in both parent zone and sub-zone:

1. The one in the sub-zone will take effect
2. If the NS record is configured in the parent zone, the record matches the sub-zone pattern will be ignored
3. If the record is not in the sub-zone, it is not resolvable, even it is in the parent zone

At least it is the Route53 bahavior
