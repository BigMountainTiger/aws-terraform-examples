We can create a sub hosted zone

If we own example.com
=> we can create a hosted zone "sub.example.com"
=> we can add record to "sub.example.com", such as "web.sub.example.com"

To make the sub zone able to resolve records
We need to create a NS record in the "example.com"
=> named "sub.example.com"
=> type NS
=> Values are the zone name servers of the sub hosted zone
=> Find the zone name servers - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-inactive.html
