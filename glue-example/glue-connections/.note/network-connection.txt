Glue can not be provisioned into a VPC, but it can use connections to access resources in the VPC

With NETWORK connection, the glue job can issue HTTP requests to host only accessible within the VPC

Terraform - https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/glue_connection

In particular, it is possible to create a "NETWORK" connection type:
connection_type â€“ (Optional) Type of the connection. Valid values: 
AZURECOSMOS, AZURESQL, BIGQUERY, CUSTOM, JDBC, KAFKA, MARKETPLACE, MONGODB, NETWORK, OPENSEARCH, SNOWFLAKE. Defaults to JDBC.

A NETWORK connection, need the physical_connection_requirements Block with the following arguments:

- availability_zone - (Optional) The availability zone of the connection.
    This field is redundant and implied by subnet_id, but is currently an api requirement.
- security_group_id_list - (Optional) The security group ID list used by the connection.
- subnet_id - (Optional) The subnet ID used by the connection.

The security group needs a self referencing inbound and a self referencing outbound rule to all ports
- More experiment is needed to see if this is really needed
