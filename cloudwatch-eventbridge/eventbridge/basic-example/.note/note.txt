EventBridge is the evolution of Amazon CloudWatch Events

Amazon EventBridge Event Bus
Amazon EventBridge rules
Amazon EventBridge events
Events from AWS services

1. There are 2 kinds of events:
    - Scheduled events - Time based events, do not rely on an event Bus
    - Non-Scheduled events - rely on an event Bus
2. Every AWS account has a default event Bus
    - We can create additional event buses as needed
3. Events are routed by the rules - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html
    - An event is evaluated against all the rules on the event bus and delivered to all the targets of all the matching rules
    - If no matching rule found, the event is discarded. If you have archive enabled, they will be added to the archive
    - An event rule can have up to 5 targets

Scheduled events are defined by cron expressions
No-Scheduled event rules are defined by event matching pattern defind as a json
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.html
    - * Notice the matching value is in the "[]" square brackets
    - We can build more complex matching rules - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-pattern-operators.html
        - prefix, suffix, anything-but, wildcard, and many more

This is a pattern that matches all the events
{
  "source": [{
    "prefix": ""
  }]
}
